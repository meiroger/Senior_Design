The raw_data folder contains the csv file of raw data which percentages and averages were extracted from for the simulations.

"LFH ED arrival rate 2019.xlsx" is the excel sheet that the hospitals used to record general ED patient arrivals, which the simulations parse in order to calculate time varying arrival rates.

Every jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) contains code for each of the simulations with their names detailing their specific scenario.

The dashboard folder contains form.html, styling.css, and evaluate.js. form.html is the form for the Bayesian prediction dashboard which can be opened in a browser.
